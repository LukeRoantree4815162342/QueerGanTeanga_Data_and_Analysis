Datasets and analysis utilities to support research connected to the 'Queer Gan Teanga, Queer Gan Anam' paper (in preparation for submission to the Irish Journal of Sociology)

---

#### Requirements:

The Python code samples provided in `analysis_utilities/` require the libraries specified in `requirements.txt`, which can be installed via 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To use them within a Jupyter Notebook environment (as provided), the libraries `jupyter` and `ipykernel` are also required.


Alternatively, you can interact with the data and code examples in the cloud via [MyBinder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) without downloading / installing anything:
